These scripts will help you set up a chroot for running your GoogleSharing server in.

The overly simplistic version of a how-to is:
* Run the setup-chrootdir-shell.sh
* Run googlesharing using makejail and the provided makejail-user.py script
* Do this several times and make sure to init all GoogleSharing functionality so the right python dependencies are pulled in
